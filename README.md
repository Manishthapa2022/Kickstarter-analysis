# Kickstarter-analysis
Performance analysis on data to understand trends
## Overview of the Project
To carry out detailed analysis on the Kickstarter data to provide meaning results.The following deliverables are provided:
- Outcomes based on the launch date
- Outcomes based on Goals
- Written analysis of the result
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to understand how dfferent campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. By carrying out analysis on the Kickstarter data,we will be able to provide Lousie with a detaled feedback on campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and challenges

### Analysis of the outcomes based on Launch Dates

The above chart shows the various parameters such as the sucess, failure and cancelation for campaigns carried out based on Launch Dates. It can been that there is an profund increase in the number of successful projects from March(56) and it peaks till May (111). The success rate declines from there until the Sept (59) with marginal increase in Oct (65) and then eventually it drops till Dec() whe the number of the successful and failed projects are almost the same. 
There seems to be very slight impact on the failed projects based on the launch dates and almost no impact in case of canceled projects. 
### Analysis of the outcomes based on Goals

In the above chart, the goals have been have been split into various brackets such as leass than 1000, 1000 to 4999 and so on and then the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns are compared based on the goals. It can be seen that when the goals are from (less than 1000) to (10000 to 14999), the success percentage is more. Also, one more key observation is that at seveeral brackets  
### Challenges and difficulties encountered
## Results
Based on the analysis conducted on the Kickstarter data, the following conculsions/observations were made:
### Conclusions made on Outcomes based on Launch Dates 
- Most of the successful plays were launched in the month of May(111) followed by June(100), July(87) and August(72). To achieve maximum success, it is recommended to launch the campaign from May to August.  
- The poorest success rate was seen during the month of December (37 which is almost 50%), hence it is recommeended not to launch any plays during this month. 
- There seems be no corelation on the number of canceled projects based on the launch dates, whereas there is percentage of failed projects are higher for the October. 
### Conclusions made on Outcomes based goals
* The highest rate of the success were projects with Goals less than 1000 (75.81%), whereas as the goal requirements increased there is a decline in the success rate. 
* There is a 100% failure rate observed for projects within Goal bracket (45000 to 49999).It is highly recommended to avoid any Goals within this brackets 

### LImitations of the Data Set
There was no analysis conducted based on the Target audiance (such as Young, old, men, women or children), and ratings and the performance of the Artists. Also, the specific cites were these plays took place was not mentioned and also if any promotions/advertisements were carried out prior to the launch of the plays.
